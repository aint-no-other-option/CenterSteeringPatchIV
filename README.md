# CenterSteeringPatchIV
A patch for GTA IV to get rid of the game centering your steering after exiting a vehicle

Supports 1.0.7.0, 1.0.8.0, and CE (latest Steam version).
Build as Release x86. Requires nothing else but an ASI loader. Not even ScriptHook.


Huge shout out to Zolika for narrowing down a lot of memory offsets and documenting it publicly.
