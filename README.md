# CenterSteeringPatchIV 3.0
A patch for GTA IV to get rid of the game centering your steering after exiting a vehicle

Supports 1.0.7.0, 1.0.8.0, and CE (latest Steam version). Works on EFLC as well, I tested TBOGT.
Build as Release x86. Requires nothing else but an ASI loader. Not even ScriptHook.


Huge shout out to Zolika for narrowing down a lot of memory offsets and documenting it publicly.
